# Notes to Paul Graham's book On Lisp in Hy language

On Lisp is an advanced (Common) Lisp book, which is available on the author's website as a free download: https://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html

Here I collect my quick notes and implementations of the book's concepts in Hy language.

Hy is a LISP for Python: https://hylang.org/

## Installation

There is really nothing to install beyond Python and the `hy` package to use this repo.

Then one can start the scripts with `hy <filename>.hy`
